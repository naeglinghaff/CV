## A former copywriter and marketing manager ##

*Translation: a detail-orientated, fast-learning creative with a stubborn streak who doesn't know when to quit.*

In the last year, I've organised South African conferences from a beach in Rio, surpassed revenue targets from a surf camp in Costa Rica and written top performing adverts from cafés in Colombia. Juggling timezones, deadlines and projects as I went. 

The problem was everything starting to get a bit too easy.

When you’re naturally organised it’s not that difficult to manage multiple marketing campaigns, handle logistics and write converting copy at the same time, even from the other side of the world. When someone asks you - “can you help me with this?” You say “sure”, and figure out a way to get it done. You solve the problems one step at a time.

But now I'd like to use the skills I've developed in my career to build cool things, rather than to sell them. I'd like to work in an industry that values and promotes personal growth. I'd like to spend the rest of my life learning something new every single day. 

## The things I do best ##

• Paying attention to the little things:

Copywriting is all in the details. With some thorough A/B testing I have been able to generate and tweak content to promote a subscription product, achieving open rates of 88% and click through rates of 26% as part of a digital advertising campaign. In my freelance work, I've also proofed and edited hundreds of academic submissions ranging from PHD theses to undergraduate essays, earning a 5 star approval rating along the way. 

• Solving problems:

I've been selling conferences for several years but I've never had to organise one before. While I was in Buenos Aires I coordinated a conference in Cape Town for 120 people solving the unexpected problems as they emerged. Such as our graphic designer going AWOL on the day the signage went to print. I managed to source orignial ai files and updated them myself on photoshop (which I'd never used  before) and the conference recieved the highest level of feedback from our delegates in the history of that event. 

 • Communication and project management:

In 2019 I was promoted to manage marketing strategy and campaigns at a financial media start-up for their event portfolio worth over £5,000,000 per annum. That year I helped manage our team of 8 to achieve 10% growth for the £550,000 commodity finance event and even managed to exceed an event target by 29% while I was working from a Costa Rican jungle.

• Writing:

I've written copy for emails, brochures, websites, landing-pages and social media. Previously, contributed to a 66% increase for engagement across our social media platforms and a 40% increase in marketing revenue by 40% compared to the previous year.

## Things I've done ##



## Things I like ##
*(That aren't written in code)*

• Reading – as a former English student, this one's probably not that surprising. I’ve recently finished Jean Paul Sartre’s “The Age of Reason” which  was a barrel of laughs. 

• Art – Painting and cross stitching are my current obsessions. 

• Singing – Performed at All Points East and at The Roundhouse in London. 

Over the years I’ve also been obsessed with bellydancing, fencing, weightlifting, yoga, pilates, curling, netball and dodgeball.
