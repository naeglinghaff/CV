## Things I like ##
*(That aren't written in code)*

-Reading – as a former English student, probably not that surprising. I’ve recently finished Jean Paul Sartre’s “The Age of Reason” which  was a barrel of laughs. 

-Art – Painting and cross stitching are my current obsessions. 

-Singing – Performed at All Points East and at The Roundhouse in London. 

Over the years I’ve also been obsessed with bellydancing, fencing, weightlifting, yoga, pilates, curling, netball and dodgeball.
