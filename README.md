## A former copywriter and marketing manager (wannabe dev) ##

*Translation: a detail-orientated, fast-learning creative with a stubborn streak that doesn't know when to quit.*

In the last year, I've organised South African conferences from a beach in Rio, surpassed revenue targets from a surf camp in Costa Rica and written top performing adverts from cafés in Colombia. Juggling timezones, deadlines and projects as I went. 

The problem was everything starting to get a bit too easy.

When you’re naturally organised it’s not that difficult to manage multiple marketing campaigns, handle logistics and write converting copy at the same time, even from the other side of the world. When someone asks you - “can you help me with this?” You say “sure”, and figure out a way to get it done. You solve the problems one step at a time.

But now I'd like to use the skills I've developed in my career to build cool things, rather than to sell them. I'd like to work in an industry that values and promotes personal growth. I'd like to spend the rest of my life learning something new every single day.

## Things I've done ##



## Things I like ##
*(That aren't written in code)*

-Reading – as a former English student, this one's probably not that surprising. I’ve recently finished Jean Paul Sartre’s “The Age of Reason” which  was a barrel of laughs. 

-Art – Painting and cross stitching are my current obsessions. 

-Singing – Performed at All Points East and at The Roundhouse in London. 

Over the years I’ve also been obsessed with bellydancing, fencing, weightlifting, yoga, pilates, curling, netball and dodgeball.
