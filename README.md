## Current projects

**LVC Website** - A collaborative project with a group of like-minded devs based in London. We are currently working on a website to publicise our group: London Vegan Coders. Current stack features Rails, Docker, JavaScript, AWS and React.

*PROJECT HIGHLIGHT*: applying agile processes within an experienced team. It's been a pleasure to pair with some experienced developers and to work together estimating tickets and sharing resources. Taking suggestions from the community has really helped to improve my code and led me on to a webinar series I'm currently exploring from Chris on Code, "Go from JavaScript to React".

**Age UK Volunteer Matching** - An app born at the Help for Heroes Hackathon which placed 2nd overall and my first foray into purely back end development, user experience and accessibility. Built with blood, sweat, tears and a little bit of Ruby, Rails, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

*PROJECT HIGHLIGHT*: getting to explore the challenges of design and user experience under strict time pressure, all for a good cause. My role within the group was focused on the back end of the application, working within the confines of devise and attempting to optimise database queries as we went. Now we are planning to continue to work on the project, turning the back end into an API and perfecting queries for matching seniors and volunteers.

## The things I do best ##

#### Paying attention to the little things ####

Copywriting is all in the details. With some thorough A/B testing I have been able to generate and tweak content to achieve open rates of 88% and click through rates of 26% as part of a digital advertising campaign. In my freelance work, I've also proofed and edited hundreds of academic submissions ranging from PHD theses to undergraduate essays, earning a 5 star approval rating along the way.

#### Solving problems ####

I've been selling conferences for several years but I've never had to organise one before. While I was in Buenos Aires I coordinated a conference in Cape Town for 120 people solving the unexpected problems as they emerged. Such as our graphic designer going AWOL on the day the signage went to print. I managed to source original .ai files and update them myself using Photoshop (which I'd never used  before) and the conference went on to receive the highest level of feedback from our delegates in the history of that event.

#### Communication and project management ####

In 2019 I was promoted to manage marketing strategy and campaigns at a financial media start-up. That year I helped manage our team of 8 to achieve a 10% profit growth for the £550,000 commodity finance event and even managed to exceed an event target by 29% while I was working from a Costa Rican jungle.

#### Writing ####

I've written copy for emails, brochures, websites, landing-pages and social media. Some of my work has contributed to a 66% increase in engagement across an organisation’s social media platforms and a 40% increase in marketing revenue, compared to the previous year.

#### Learning ####

You don't get a 1st class degree without being good at teaching yourself. Over the years I've developed a system for teaching myself new material quickly. I used to be really inflexible - now I can touch my toes. I used to have no idea what a deadlift was - I taught myself the proper form. I never knew what a byte, algorithm or binary search tree were, but I followed Harvard's CS50 course and now I do.

## Things I like ##
*(That aren't written in code)*

* Reading – as a former English student, this one's probably not that surprising. I’ve recently finished Jean Paul Sartre’s “The Age of Reason” which  was a barrel of laughs.
* Art – painting and cross stitching are my current obsessions.
* Singing – performed at All Points East and at The Roundhouse in London.
* Games - okay some of these are written in code, but I also like board games.

Over the years I’ve also been obsessed with bellydancing, fencing, weightlifting, yoga, pilates, curling, netball and dodgeball.
